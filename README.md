## Dependencies
This project relies on Gradle for dependency management, 
and uses it to install the following plugins:

| Plugin                                            | Justification                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)                     | A modern successor to Java's internal Swing API  |
| [Shadow](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow) | Allows the creation of "fat" `.jar` files        |
| [animated](https://github.com/iAmGio/animated)    | A library of Flutter-style animations for JavaFX |
| [Ikonli](https://github.com/kordamp/ikonli)       | Provides access to the Bootstrap icon set        |

## Project Overview
Broadly, this project consists of two components.

The first is a fairly generic set of classes for handling
dummy book and user data, and mainly exists to demonstrate
common OOP principles (inheritance, abstraction, interfaces),
as well as some more advanced concepts (nested objects, 
records, builders).

The second is the actual UI component, built using JavaFX. 
`TODO: finish this part`

## Building from Source
Gradle generates two files, `./gradlew` and `./gradlew.bat`,
to handle Gradle tasks on systems that don't actually have
Gradle installed.

From the root directory, run the following command.
```shell
# if you're on linux/macOS
./gradlew buildRelease

# if you're on windows
./gradlew.bat buildRelease
```

This will generate a zip archive in `build/distributions`
containing both binaries for the app, and a self-contained
`.jar` (generated by Shadow) which can be placed anywhere
on your filesystem and run.

If you'd like the project as it was submitted,
use the following command.

```shell
#if you're on linux/macOS
./gradlew buildSubmission

# if you're on windows
./gradlew.bat buildSubmission
```
